// This file can be used for shared types, but for this app structure,
// it's often cleaner to co-locate types with the hooks that produce them.
// We'll export them from the hooks directly.
// Example: export type { GeolocationData } from './hooks/useGeolocation';
// This file is kept for structural completeness.
